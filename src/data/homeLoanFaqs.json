    q: "What is Home Loan EMI?",
    a: "Home Loan EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed monthly amount paid by a borrower to repay a housing loan. It includes both principal repayment and interest charged by the lender.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is Home Loan EMI calculated?",
    a: "Home Loan EMI is calculated using a standard formula that considers loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. Higher tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest paid.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I reduce my home loan EMI?",
    a: "Yes. You can reduce EMI by increasing loan tenure, making part prepayments, negotiating a lower interest rate, or opting for a balance transfer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is lower EMI or shorter tenure better?",
    a: "Lower EMI helps monthly cash flow, while shorter tenure significantly reduces total interest paid. Shorter tenure is financially better if affordable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does interest rate change affect EMI?",
    a: "Yes. For floating rate home loans, any change in interest rate impacts EMI or loan tenure depending on the bank’s adjustment policy.",
  },
