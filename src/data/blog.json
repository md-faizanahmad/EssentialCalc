    "excerpt": "A simple explanation of the 2026 tax regime, updated slabs, deductions, and who should opt for it.",
    "content": "The 2026 financial year introduced several changes in India’s income tax structure aimed at simplifying compliance and improving take-home pay. Under the new tax regime, the standard deduction has been increased to ₹75,000, and tax slabs have been widened for middle-income earners.\n\nFor salaried individuals earning between ₹10 lakh and ₹15 lakh annually, the effective tax burden has reduced slightly compared to previous years. However, the new regime still removes popular deductions such as 80C, HRA, and home loan interest benefits.\n\nThis means the new tax regime works best for individuals who prefer simplicity and do not actively invest in tax-saving instruments. Before choosing, it is important to calculate tax under both regimes and compare the final payable amount."

    "excerpt": "Learn how much of your salary should ideally go toward EMI without hurting your finances.",
    "content": "A common financial mistake is overcommitting to EMIs without leaving room for savings and emergencies. A practical guideline followed by many financial planners is the 50/30/20 rule.\n\nAccording to this rule, 50% of your monthly income should go toward essential expenses such as rent, food, and EMIs. 30% can be used for lifestyle spending, while the remaining 20% should be saved or invested.\n\nIf your total EMIs cross 40–45% of your monthly income, you may feel financial pressure during emergencies or job changes. Using an EMI calculator before taking a loan helps you stay within safe limits."

    "excerpt": "Should you pay everything upfront or choose EMI? Here’s a simple comparison.",
    "content": "When buying high-value items like electronics, vehicles, or appliances, many people face the choice between paying a lump sum or opting for EMI. While EMI spreads the cost over time, it may increase the overall amount paid due to interest.\n\nLump sum payments make sense if you have sufficient savings and want to avoid interest costs. On the other hand, EMI is helpful when you want to preserve cash flow or invest your money elsewhere.\n\nBefore deciding, always compare the interest rate, processing fees, and your monthly budget using an EMI calculator."

    "content": "Many employees are confused by the difference between CTC and in-hand salary. CTC includes basic pay, allowances, bonuses, employer PF contribution, and other benefits.\n\nYour in-hand salary is what you receive after deductions such as employee PF, professional tax, income tax, and insurance contributions. These deductions vary based on salary structure and tax regime.\n\nUsing a salary calculator helps you estimate your actual monthly take-home pay and plan expenses more accurately."

    "content": "Home loans usually run for long tenures, making EMI management critical. One effective way to reduce EMI is choosing a longer tenure, though this increases total interest paid.\n\nMaking part prepayments whenever you receive bonuses or extra income can significantly reduce interest costs. Opting for a lower interest rate lender or switching to a balance transfer option can also help.\n\nRegularly tracking your EMI using a calculator allows you to understand how small adjustments affect long-term repayment."

    "content": "Personal loans are easy to obtain but can become expensive if not managed properly. One common mistake is ignoring the interest rate and focusing only on EMI amount.\n\nBorrowers often take multiple loans simultaneously, leading to high debt obligations. Not reading the loan agreement carefully may result in unexpected charges such as foreclosure or late payment fees.\n\nBefore applying, calculate your EMI, assess repayment capacity, and ensure the loan fits within your long-term financial plan."
