    "excerpt": "A clear and practical explanation of the 2026 tax regime, updated slabs, deductions removed, and who should opt for it.",
    "content": "The Financial Year 2026 introduced further refinements to India’s New Tax Regime with the objective of simplifying income tax compliance and increasing take-home pay for salaried individuals. The most notable change is the increase in the standard deduction to ₹75,000 for salaried taxpayers, which directly reduces taxable income without requiring any investment proofs.\n\nTax slabs under the new regime have been widened, particularly benefiting middle-income earners. For individuals earning between ₹10 lakh and ₹15 lakh annually, the effective tax burden has reduced compared to earlier years, provided they do not heavily rely on deductions. Additionally, the rebate under Section 87A continues to play a crucial role in lowering tax liability for eligible taxpayers, subject to conditions prescribed in the Finance Act.\n\nHowever, the new regime still removes popular deductions such as Section 80C investments, House Rent Allowance (HRA), and home loan interest benefits under Section 24(b). This makes it less attractive for individuals who actively invest in tax-saving instruments or have significant housing loans.\n\nIn summary, the new tax regime works best for taxpayers who prefer simplicity, have fewer deductions, and want predictable tax outgo. Before opting in, it is strongly advised to calculate tax liability under both the old and new regimes and choose the option that results in lower overall tax."

    "content": "ITR and GST are two important tax compliances in India. ITR applies to individuals, while GST applies to businesses. Many people are confused about what they need to file and when. This guide explains both in simple words.\n\nITR Compliance:\nIncome Tax Return (ITR) is filed by individuals to report income, claim refunds, and maintain financial records. Even people with zero income can file a Nil ITR.\n\nStep 1: Keep PAN, Aadhaar, bank details, and Form 16 (if salaried) ready.\n\nStep 2: Visit the official income tax website https://www.incometax.gov.in and log in using PAN as your user ID.\n\nStep 3: Select the correct ITR form. Most salaried people use ITR-1. Freelancers and business owners usually file ITR-3 or ITR-4.\n\nStep 4: Check pre-filled income details shown in AIS and Form 26AS.\n\nStep 5: Submit the return and complete e-verification using Aadhaar OTP or net banking.\n\nFiling ITR on time helps with loan approvals, visa applications, and avoids late filing penalties.\n\nGST Compliance:\nGST return filing is mandatory for businesses registered under GST, even if there are no sales during the month.\n\nStep 1: Keep sales and purchase invoices ready for the return period.\n\nStep 2: Visit the GST portal https://www.gst.gov.in and log in using GSTIN and password.\n\nStep 3: Go to Services > Returns > Returns Dashboard and select the return month.\n\nStep 4: File GSTR-1 by entering sales details.\n\nStep 5: Check GSTR-2B to confirm eligible Input Tax Credit (ITC).\n\nStep 6: Pay tax if required and file GSTR-3B.\n\nIf there are no sales or purchases, a Nil GST return must still be filed. Missing GST returns can result in late fees, blocked filings, or GST cancellation.\n\nMaintaining both ITR and GST compliance on time keeps your financial and business records clean and avoids unnecessary notices or penalties."

    "excerpt": "Learn how much of your salary should ideally go toward EMIs without putting pressure on savings or lifestyle.",
    "content": "One of the most common financial mistakes is committing to high EMIs without considering long-term sustainability. A widely accepted framework for managing income is the 50/30/20 rule.\n\nAccording to this rule, 50% of your monthly income should be allocated to essential expenses such as rent, groceries, utilities, and EMIs. The next 30% can be spent on lifestyle choices like travel and entertainment, while the remaining 20% should be reserved for savings and investments.\n\nFinancial planners generally advise keeping total EMIs below 40–45% of monthly income. Crossing this limit increases financial stress during emergencies or job changes.\n\nUsing an EMI calculator before taking any loan helps you stay within safe limits and maintain long-term financial stability."
