    "date": "Jan 22, 2026",
    "excerpt": "A clear and practical explanation of the 2026 tax regime, updated slabs, deductions removed, and who should opt for it.",
    "content": "The Financial Year 2026 introduced further refinements to India’s New Tax Regime with the objective of simplifying income tax compliance and increasing take-home pay for salaried individuals. The most notable change is the increase in the standard deduction to ₹75,000 for salaried taxpayers, which directly reduces taxable income without requiring any investment proofs.\n\nTax slabs under the new regime have been widened, particularly benefiting middle-income earners. For individuals earning between ₹10 lakh and ₹15 lakh annually, the effective tax burden has reduced compared to earlier years, provided they do not heavily rely on deductions. Additionally, the rebate under Section 87A continues to play a crucial role in lowering tax liability for eligible taxpayers, subject to conditions prescribed in the Finance Act.\n\nHowever, the new regime still removes popular deductions such as Section 80C investments, House Rent Allowance (HRA), and home loan interest benefits under Section 24(b). This makes it less attractive for individuals who actively invest in tax-saving instruments or have significant housing loans.\n\nIn summary, the new tax regime works best for taxpayers who prefer simplicity, have fewer deductions, and want predictable tax outgo. Before opting in, it is strongly advised to calculate tax liability under both the old and new regimes and choose the option that results in lower overall tax."

    "content": "Filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) is a mandatory compliance for many individuals in India and an important financial record. Even if your income is below the taxable limit, filing ITR helps in loan approvals, visa processing, and carrying forward losses.\n\nStep 1: Gather required documents such as PAN, Aadhaar, Form 16 (for salaried individuals), bank interest certificates, capital gains statements, and details of deductions.\n\nStep 2: Log in to the Income Tax e-filing portal using your PAN as user ID. Ensure your Aadhaar is linked and mobile number is active for OTP verification.\n\nStep 3: Select the correct ITR form. ITR-1 is for salaried individuals with simple income, ITR-2 for individuals with capital gains, ITR-3 for business owners, and ITR-4 for presumptive income.\n\nStep 4: Verify pre-filled details using AIS and Form 26AS. Correct any mismatches before submission.\n\nStep 5: Compute tax payable, pay any pending tax, submit the return, and e-verify it using Aadhaar OTP, net banking, or bank account verification.\n\nFiling ITR accurately and on time avoids penalties and strengthens your financial credibility."

    "date": "Jan 15, 2026",
    "excerpt": "Learn how much of your salary should ideally go toward EMIs without putting pressure on savings or lifestyle.",
    "content": "One of the most common financial mistakes is committing to high EMIs without considering long-term sustainability. A widely accepted framework for managing income is the 50/30/20 rule.\n\nAccording to this rule, 50% of your monthly income should be allocated to essential expenses such as rent, groceries, utilities, and EMIs. The next 30% can be spent on lifestyle choices like travel and entertainment, while the remaining 20% should be reserved for savings and investments.\n\nFinancial planners generally advise keeping total EMIs below 40–45% of monthly income. Crossing this limit increases financial stress during emergencies or job changes.\n\nUsing an EMI calculator before taking any loan helps you stay within safe limits and maintain long-term financial stability."
